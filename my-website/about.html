    <p>
      I'm a poet and musician born and raised in the county of dade—Miami, FL.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make narrative rap about whatever I want to understand—whether it's the perspective of future space traverlers or someone that makes tea for a living.<br>
      My work can be thought of as research in the form of rap. Or just storytelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also a creative programmer (that's just fancy for poet).<br> 
      I develop hardware and software tools for music education and overall creative expression. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Challenging and exploring what's around me,<br> 
      inviting others to join in the process, and creating interactive experiences is at the heart of what I do.
